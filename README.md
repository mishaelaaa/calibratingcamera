# Calibrating Camera

## Why is camera calibration important?

Whenever we are using cameras in any system, say, in autonomous driving systems in the passenger cars, we need to make sure that the camera installed in that car is accurate. When I say accurate, I mean the camera should have high precision, resolution and low or no distortion.
High precision means camera should provide same output for the same input in all kinds of environmental conditions. High resolution means that the camera should be able to decipher the smallest possible change. So, the camera should be calibrated to achieve higher accuracy and low distortion which helps in achieving the higher accurate representation of the real world in the captured images.
